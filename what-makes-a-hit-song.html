							<h1>What Makes a Hit Song?</h1>
							<b>Tools Used:</b><p>Microsoft SQL Server, Excel, Tableau</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/spotifycropped.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this project, I embarked on a captivating journey through data analysis and visualization, leveraging my skills in SQL, Excel, and Tableau to uncover the hidden stories within Spotify's top-streamed songs of 2023. The final dashboard and associated links to this project are included at the end.</p>
							<h2>Key Question: What makes a hit song?</h2>
							<p>We are using data of the top streamed songs on Spotify of 2023 from Kaggle.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/spotifyall.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I first started by importing the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023">data</a> into Microsoft SQL Server. I then got started on my queries. I first wanted to see which artists are behind the most tracks in the dataset. However, many songs have multiple artists, who are named all in the same column. Before I can count up all the artists, I first need to extract all of the artists out of the artist(s)_name column. I first attempt to do this by using PARSENAME. However, I run into trouble because PARSENAME has an extract limit of four, and the maximum number of artists for one song in the dataset is eight. Additionally, there are a couple of artists in the dataset with periods in their name, which would not allow the PARSENAME function to extract as I want. My solution to this is to create a custom function that can extract the artists without limit. The following custom function does as such. It also allows me to input my own delimeter, so I don't need to use REPLACE like I would with PARSENAME, and the function will still be able to extract artists with periods in their name properly.</p>  
							<pre><code> 
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.CustomPARSENAME (
    @String NVARCHAR(MAX),
    @Delimiter CHAR(1),
    @Part INT
)
RETURNS NVARCHAR(MAX)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @Result NVARCHAR(MAX)
    DECLARE @DelimiterCount INT

    -- Initialize variables
    SET @Result = NULL  -- Initialize to NULL
    SET @DelimiterCount = 0

    -- Loop through the string
    WHILE LEN(@String) > 0
    BEGIN
        SET @DelimiterCount = @DelimiterCount + 1
        DECLARE @NextDelimiterPosition INT
        SET @NextDelimiterPosition = CHARINDEX(@Delimiter, @String)

        IF @NextDelimiterPosition > 0
        BEGIN
            -- Found a delimiter, extract the part if it matches the requested part number
            IF @DelimiterCount = @Part
                SET @Result = SUBSTRING(@String, 1, @NextDelimiterPosition - 1)
            
            -- Remove the extracted part and delimiter from the string
            SET @String = SUBSTRING(@String, @NextDelimiterPosition + 1, LEN(@String) - @NextDelimiterPosition)
        END
        ELSE
        BEGIN
            -- No more delimiters, treat the whole string as the last part if it matches the requested part number
            IF @DelimiterCount = @Part
                SET @Result = @String
            
            -- Exit the loop
            BREAK
        END
    END

    RETURN @Result
END
							</code></pre> 
							<p>Now I can use this custom function, dbo.CustomPARSENAME(), to extract each artist out of the artist(s)_name column.</p>
							<pre><code>
SELECT
	track_name,
	[artist(s)_name], 
	artist_count,
	dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 8) AS artist_8,
	dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 7) AS artist_7,
	dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 6) AS artist_6,
	dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 5) AS artist_5,
	dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 4) AS artist_4,
	dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 3) AS artist_3,
	dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 2) AS artist_2,
	dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 1) AS artist_1
FROM ['spotify-2023$']
							</code></pre>
							<img src="images/spotifyextract.png" alt="" style="width:1021px;height:412px;">
							<br><br>
							<p>I now need to get all these extracted artists into one column so that I can count them up. I do this by creating a CTE with the previous output and using UNION ALL to stack the eight coulumns on top of each other. I noticed that there were some trailing spaces in the artist names, so I also TRIM the artist names. And of course, we have to remove all of the nulls. I use COUNT and GROUP BY to count how many times each artist appears in the dataset, and I have SQL return the results to me in descending order of number of appearances.</p>
							<pre><code>
WITH SplitArtistsCTE AS
(
	SELECT
		track_name,
		[artist(s)_name], 
		artist_count,
		dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 8) AS artist_8,
		dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 7) AS artist_7,
		dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 6) AS artist_6,
		dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 5) AS artist_5,
		dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 4) AS artist_4,
		dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 3) AS artist_3,
		dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 2) AS artist_2,
		dbo.CustomPARSENAME([artist(s)_name], ', ', 1) AS artist_1
	FROM ['spotify-2023$']
)
SELECT
	LTRIM(RTRIM(artist_1)) AS trimmed_artist,
	COUNT(artist_1) AS artist_count
FROM
(
	SELECT artist_1
	FROM SplitArtistsCTE
	UNION ALL
	SELECT artist_2
	FROM SplitArtistsCTE
	UNION ALL
	SELECT artist_3
	FROM SplitArtistsCTE
	UNION ALL
	SELECT artist_4
	FROM SplitArtistsCTE
	UNION ALL
	SELECT artist_5
	FROM SplitArtistsCTE
	UNION ALL
	SELECT artist_6
	FROM SplitArtistsCTE
	UNION ALL
	SELECT artist_7
	FROM SplitArtistsCTE
	UNION ALL
	SELECT artist_8
	FROM SplitArtistsCTE
) AS artist_list
WHERE artist_1 IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY LTRIM(RTRIM(artist_1))
ORDER BY artist_count DESC
							</code></pre> 
							<p>This gives us the following result:</p>
							<img src="images/spotifyartistcount.png" alt="" style="width:199px;height:409px;">
							<br><br>
							<p>I put this output into Excel and use that as a data source for Tableau to create a bar chart to show the artists behind the most tracks in the top streamed songs on Spotify of 2023. I decided to only include the top 10 in my visual. I also utilize a lollipop bar chart design to take after the Spotify track scrubber.</p>
							<img src="images/spotifyscrubber.png" alt="" style="width:394px;height:31px;">
							<p>We get the following visual in the end.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/spotifyviz1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Next I wanted to analyze whether there are any patterns in the release dates of popular songs. The release date in the dataset is given as integers in three separate columns: year, month (1-12), day (1-31). In my query, I want to pull the release date into one column in date format. I achieve this with CAST and CONVERT. Along with the date, I pull the track name, artist(s), and number of streams. I also only pull the top 100 tracks based on number of streams so we only look at trends with the most popular songs.</p>
							<pre><code>
SELECT
	TOP 100 track_name,
	[artist(s)_name],
	streams,
	CAST(CONVERT(NVARCHAR(4), [released_year]) + '-' + 
			 RIGHT('0' + CONVERT(NVARCHAR(2), [released_month]), 2) + '-' + 
			 RIGHT('0' + CONVERT(NVARCHAR(2), [released_day]), 2) AS DATE) AS release_date
FROM ['spotify-2023$']
ORDER BY streams DESC
							</code></pre> 
							<p>This query returns the following result:</p>
							<img src="images/spotifydate.png" alt="" style="width:586px;height:409px;">
							<br><br>
							<p>I did not end up including this in my final dashboard, but visualizing this with Tableau gets us the following result:</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/spotifydateviz.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Though older songs may have had more time to accumulate streams, we see a preference for newer songs.</p>
							<p>Next I wanted to find any correlations between song characteristics (e.g. danceability, valence, energy) and the number of streams. I write the following query to get the relevant data needed:</p>	
							<pre><code>
SELECT
	track_name,
	[artist(s)_name],
	streams,
	bpm,
	[key]+' '+mode AS key_mode,
	[danceability_%],
	[energy_%],
	[acousticness_%],
	[instrumentalness_%],
	[liveness_%],
	[speechiness_%]
FROM ['spotify-2023$']
ORDER BY streams DESC
							</code></pre>
							<p>This query gives us the following output:</p>
							<img src="images/spotifydc.png" alt="" style="width:1114px;height:411px;">
							<br><br>
							<p> I use this data to create scatter plots to visualize number of streams vs. each of the song characteristics, wth trend lines included.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/spotifyscatter.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Next, I wanted to look at the impact of playlists and charts across several platforms on the number of Spotify streams. I write the following query to pull the relevant data needed:</p>
							<pre><code>
SELECT
	track_name,
	[artist(s)_name],
	streams,
	in_spotify_playlists,
	in_spotify_charts,
	in_apple_playlists,
	in_apple_charts,
	in_deezer_playlists,
	in_deezer_charts,
	in_shazam_charts
FROM ['spotify-2023$']
ORDER BY streams DESC
							</code></pre>
							<p>Running this query gives us the following output:</p>
							<img src="images/spotifypc.png" alt="" style="width:1198px;height: 411px;">
							<br><br>
							<p>I then use Tableau to create scatter plots to show and compare the impact of being in playlists and charts across different platforms on the number of Spotify streams.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/spotifyplaylistviz.png" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/spotifychartsviz.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Finally, I wanted to create histograms to visualize the distributions of audio features like BPM and song key. The dataset had two columns for key (i.e. A, A#, B etc.) and mode (major vs. minor), but I wanted to combine these two to simply show the keys as "A Major", for example. I write a query to pull the data needed for these histograms, and to combine the key and mode columns.</p>
							<pre><code>
SELECT
	track_name,
	[artist(s)_name],
	streams,
	bpm,
	[key]+' '+mode AS key_mode
FROM ['spotify-2023$']
							</code></pre>
							<p>This query gives us the following result:</p>
							<img src="images/spotifykey.png" alt="" style="width:643px;height: 409px;">
							<br><br>
							<p>Tableau helps us create a histogram to show the distribution of top songs streamed on Spotify of 2023 across different beats per minute (bpm), and across different keys. Since the key "histogram" is technically just a bar chart, I can make make the key histogram take after the Spotify scrubber as well.</p>
							<img src="images/spotifybpmviz.png" alt="" style="width:669px;height: 374px;">
							<img src="images/spotifykeyviz.png" alt="" style="width:669px;height: 373px;">
							<br><br>
							<p>So, what makes a hit song? If we are to go by the implications of this data, surprisingly, a song that not <i>too</i> danceable. An energetic song in C# major and between 120 and 127 bpm. A song that has vocal content but at the same time is not too speechy. A studio recorded song with some acoustic instruments. Being in people's playlists and getting onto music streaming charts helps. Oh, and it doesn't hurt to have Bad Bunny in there either.</p>
							<p>Finally, we can throw all of the visualizations together into one dashboard:</p>
